# Beginners' preprocessing

This is a simple manual preprocessing. Idea is to familiarise students with the basic image algebra manipulation.

Teaching plan is the following:

- review knowledge about light, dark, flat images, and how to extract the science values
- make them write simple procedures using `astropy.io.fits` and `numpy` to average combine, subtract, divide
- give them the ability to compare their code vs a sample written by the tutors
- show them the quick, high-end process in `preprocessing`
